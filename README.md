A generalized functional interface is created.  
A class with one method is written.  
This method implements the logic:  
	- if the number 1 is entered into the console, then:   
using an interface with a string type and the logic of string reversal (outputting a string in reverse order) is passed to the interface method.  
	- if the number 2 is entered into the console, then:  
using an interface with integer type and the logic of finding the factorial of a number is passed to the interface method.
